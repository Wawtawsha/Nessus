# Milestone v1.2: Lead Management

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-15
**Phases:** 6-8
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Milestone v1.2 expands lead capture beyond website forms with manual entry capability and a dedicated cold-calling client. Phase 6 extends the database schema with new lead fields (has_website, social_media_presence) and creates a Cold Calling client that shows leads-only view. Phase 7 builds the manual "Add Lead" form UI across all clients' leads pages. Phase 8 adds edit capability to the lead detail page so manually-entered leads can be corrected.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Database + Cold Calling Client
**Goal**: Cold Calling client exists as leads-only view and lead schema supports new qualification fields
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (v1.1 complete)
**Requirements**: CLIENT-01, CLIENT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees "Cold Calling" in client sidebar as an active client
  2. When Cold Calling is selected, only Leads tab is visible (no Visits, Orders, Pipeline, Analytics tabs)
  3. Leads table has has_website (boolean) and social_media_presence (1-5 integer) columns
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md -- Cold Calling client + lead schema extension + client-type tab filtering

### Phase 7: Manual Lead Entry UI
**Goal**: Users can manually add leads from any client's leads page
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (schema extended, Cold Calling client exists)
**Requirements**: LEAD-01, LEAD-02, LEAD-03, LEAD-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  2. Clicking Add Lead opens form that captures: first name, last name, email, phone, preferred contact, SMS consent, has_website, social_media_presence
  3. All form fields are optional (no required validation)
  4. After submitting, new lead appears in leads list within 5 seconds
**Plans**: 1 plan

**Depends on**: Phase 7 (Add Lead form exists)
**Requirements**: EDIT-01
